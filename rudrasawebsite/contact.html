                organizations?While reviewing the outsourced IT functions at a very large global 
                engineering servicescorporate, information security was supposedly given 
                due importance. To our utter surprise,
                  it was found that all the admin level user info including passwords, 
                  IP addresses, 
                  and connection information were stored in an excel sheet. Even worse, 
                  the excel sheet was shared with many outsourced staff on laptops that 
                  were neither securely configured nor insured. The impact of the combined 
                  risks was then highlighted to the IT Top Management and corrective measures 
                  implemented forthwith.</p></td><td><img src="techexpertise.jpg"></td></tr>
