		HTML, CSS  , JavaScript
		
		
		JavaScript: Language  --> What do you mean by a Language --> To  Interact/Communicate we use language
		
		--> JavaScript  -->  Who is speaking? who is listening?
		
		
		Programmer ... Developer  -- User > System/Machine  --> understands only  --> 0 and 1  --> On and Off --> Electricity --> ASCII  A --56
		
		Language--> to interact with the machine
		
		
		JavaScript --> LightWeight  ->> Weight less  --> File Sizes are very less to work with  --> 
									No need to install any external software/Any Dependencies to run a JavaScript Program
									
									Dynamic : JavaScript program will be converted to machine understandable language --> Conversion happens in two ways:
									
									line by line conversion -- throws errors at the same line and terminates the execution  --> 
									
									error is nothing but which is not understandable / bugs
									
									Compilation 
									
									It converts all the program at a time and lists all the errors --> Dynamic Conversion --> Interpretation 
									
									JavaScript follows Interpretation --> Dynamic Language
									
		JavaScript --> Loosly Typed --> There is a unit to calculate or measure the capability/volume  --> 
		
		                     --> Dealing with Data --> Data has units --> Numbers, Strings, Characters, Boolean --> Data Types
							 
							 we should provide Data Type  --> JavaScript Defines the data type by its value  --> Loosely Typed 
							 
							 
							 
		
		data is defined by Variables--> var x; var name; var full_name; 
															x=10; x is a number data type
															x= "hello"--> x is a string
															
															
	<html>
	<head></head>
	<body></body>
	</html>
	
	JavaScript --> inline scripting  --> in the tag 
	
								internal --> inside <head><style></style></head> --> define the scripting inside <script></script>
								External --> .js file is defined outside and linked with the file 
								
	
	
	HTML --> Display Text / Documents/ Web Pages  in the browser
	
	CSS --> Applying Styles to the file/web page/
	
	JavaScript --> The Actual Interaction between the business user/client/ user/ and Application happens by using JavaScript
	
	
	JavaScript  --> two types we write programs 
						   --> by using functions, by using javascript objects
	
	
						function --> the instructions which are used for a particular purpose
						Object    --> Definition is called class --> the actual existence is called objects
											
											Car-- class 
											Audi --> class
											Audi c class white color 2023 model TS008tc5678  --> object
											
											
						Function --> display the colors of the object, adding the object to the cart, display the cost of the object, 
						Object  --> Service/entertainment or product sales are happening  --> selling thing 
						
						
						An Application is developed by using JavaScript following two ways --> function based and object based
						
						
						
						
						Variables-- to manage data we declare and define the variables, 
						
						document.write() is used to display on the web page/document
						
						console.log() is used to display on the console of developer tools/inspect
						
						any html tage if we want to use , write it inside of "" in document.write("")
						
						One statement need not to be ended with semi colon, 
						
						if there are more than one statement in a single line then every statement except the last should be ended with semi colon
						
						
						var x=10;
						var $x=10;
						var _x=10;
						var x123=10;
						
						the above all formats are allowed to define the variables in javascript
						
						JavaScript variables are case sensitive
